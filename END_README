Map description 		:
A massive map in the style of Serious Sam, Doom Eternal, and Doom: The Dark Ages, 
with hordes of monsters and powerful weapons.

I spent 5 days gathering resources and studying the ID24 format.
The map was created between May 21, 2025, and May 31, 2025.

Commentary	 		: 

The map was made in about 10 days â€” a very intense speedmapping session. 
It's a fully playable map featuring large-scale battles, though the fights are relatively 
manageable compared to other popular slaughter maps.

It includes many new enemies, enhanced versions of classic ones, and, 
to counter them, you're given new and unconventional weapons.

Experimenting with the unreleased ID24 format provided a huge advantage, 
helping secure 5th place out of 27 participants in EMC2025.
